  // Step 1: For each recipe in the recipe list
  // Step 2: Iterate through list of solutions, and check if remaining ingredients can cook the recipe. If cookable, append to the particular solutions list
  // Step 3: Check if the full list of ingredients can cook the current recipe, if so, add it as a new possible solution.
  // Step 4: After finishing. Run an algo to check which is optimal and return the most optimal solutions
  // For each recipe
